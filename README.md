## Inspiration
We attended a patient safety workshop and were shocked to learn that many patient deaths and serious consequences could have been avoided with more careful attention to their medical care. This inspired us to create an easy-to-navigate platform where patients can share their struggles and highlight their experiences. We also wanted to build a comprehensive space for users to take a more active role in managing their health.

## What it does
WaddleWell is a platform designed to help users manage and access resources for improving their health. Users can create a personalized patient profile, listing their medical history for easy access by doctors and healthcare institutions. The platform allows users to track upcoming appointments, report and discuss medical incidents, and find resources for staying healthy.

## How we built it
We built our website using React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

## Challenges we ran into
This was our first hackathon and we initially struggled to come up with an idea that was both meaningful and feasible to implement within the limited timeframe. We faced challenges with deploying our application and ensuring that all components functioned correctly. A significant amount of time was spent debugging.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of ourselves for taking on this challenge and collaborating together to bring this project to life. It was gratifying when we did figure out a bug and completed a step towards our goal.

## What we learned
Throughout the process, we honed our abilities in version control, task delegation, and problem-solving. We gained more experience with React, styling, and utilizing various libraries.

## What's next for WaddleWell
Adapting WaddleWell to be responsive towards different devices. Recommending personalized resources based on the patient's medical history and highlighting potential complications to watch out for.
